            <h2 class="inner-title">Double Hung</h2>
            <div class="our-story">
              <!-- <h4>Definition</h4> -->
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>A double-hung window is a type of window made up of two separate sashes — one on the top and one on the bottom — that slide vertically within the frame. Both sashes move independently, meaning you can open either the top, the bottom, or both at the same time.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Two Movable Sashes:</h5> Each sash operates on its own track, allowing flexible ventilation. You can open the bottom sash to let fresh air in, or open the top sash to release warm air.</p>
              <p><h5>Tilt-in design:</h5> Both sashes can tilt inward, making it easy to clean the exterior glass from inside your home without using a ladder.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior screen:</h5> The screen is placed on the outside of the window, preventing insects from entering while the window is open.</p>
              <p><h5>Block and tackle balance system:</h5> Inside the frame, a system of cords and pulleys helps the sashes move smoothly up and down. This system is built for long-term use and can withstand thousands of open-and-close cycles before any maintenance is needed.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Flexible ventilation:</h5> Double-hung windows allow you to control airflow naturally. Opening both sashes lets warm air escape through the top and cool air enter through the bottom, improving comfort and air circulation.</p>
              <p><h5>Easy maintenance:</h5> The tilt-in feature makes cleaning quick and safe, since both sides of the glass are accessible from inside the home.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy efficiency:</h5> Modern double-hung windows are designed with insulated glass and advanced weather sealing, helping to reduce drafts and improve energy performance year-round.</p>
              <p><h5>Classic appearance:</h5> Their traditional design complements most home styles, from historic to contemporary, adding a timeless look to the exterior.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential homes:</h5> Double-hung windows are among the most popular styles in homes because they combine beauty, function, and convenience.</p>
              <p><h5>Limited exterior space:</h5> Because the sashes move vertically rather than swinging outward, these windows are ideal for areas where space outside is limited — such as near walkways, porches, or patios.</p>

            <h2 class="inner-title">Casement Windows</h2>
            <div class="our-story">
              <!-- <h4>Definition</h4> -->
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Casement windows are hinged windows that open outward like a door. They are typically operated by a crank or lever mechanism, allowing easy and precise control over how far the window opens.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Hinged Design:</h5> Casement windows are hinged on one side, enabling them to swing open either to the left or right.</p>
              <p><h5>Crank or Lever Operation:</h5> Operated by a crank or lever, these windows allow smooth and adjustable opening and closing.</p>
              <p><h5>Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are generally installed on the inside to protect them from weather exposure and to keep insects out when the window is open.</p>
              <p><h5>Blinds Between the Glass:</h5> Casement windows can be customized with integrated blinds positioned between the glass panes. This feature provides a clean, low-maintenance appearance and allows for easy light control. (Note: blinds between the glass cannot be combined with decorative grids.)</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Unobstructed Views:</h5> Casement windows feature large, uninterrupted glass panels that enhance natural light and provide clear outdoor visibility.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> The sash presses firmly against the frame when closed, creating a tight seal that minimizes air leakage and improves thermal performance.</p>
              <p><h5>Superior Ventilation:</h5> When opened, the sash catches and directs breezes into the home, maximizing airflow.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Security:</h5> Casement windows often include hook-shaped locks embedded into the frame, making them highly resistant to forced entry.</p>
              <p><h5>Modern Customization Options:</h5> Integrated blinds between the glass offer a neat, contemporary appearance and are easy to operate and maintain.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Homes:</h5> Widely used in homes for their combination of ventilation, visibility, and energy efficiency.</p>
              <p><h5>Modern and Contemporary Architecture:</h5> Their clean lines and functional design complement modern architectural aesthetics.</p>
              <p><h5>Rooms Requiring Controlled Ventilation:</h5> Ideal for areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, or any space where precise airflow control is desired.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Hopper windows are small, hinged windows that open inward from the top. They are typically used in basements, bathrooms, or other confined areas where ventilation and natural light are needed.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Bottom-Hinged Design:</h5> Hopper windows are hinged at the bottom, allowing them to open inward from the top.</p>
              <p><h5>Compact Size:</h5> Their smaller dimensions make them ideal for spaces with limited room.</p>
              <p><h5>Locking Mechanism:</h5> They feature secure locks that keep the window tightly closed when not in use.</p>
              <p><h5>Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are positioned on the exterior side to prevent insects from entering when the window is open.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Efficient Ventilation:</h5> Hopper windows provide strong air circulation, making them great for humid or enclosed spaces.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Security:</h5> Their inward-opening design and locking system make them hard to force open from the outside.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> When closed, they form a tight seal that minimizes drafts and improves insulation.</p>
              <p><h5>Easy Maintenance:</h5> The inward-opening motion allows easy cleaning of both interior and exterior glass surfaces.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Basements:</h5> Commonly used to allow fresh air and light in underground or partially below-ground rooms.</p>
              <p><h5>Bathrooms:</h5> Provide ventilation and moisture control while maintaining privacy.</p>
              <p><h5>Compact Spaces:</h5> Perfect for tight or narrow wall openings where standard windows won't fit.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Double-slider windows feature two horizontally sliding sashes that move side-to-side within a single frame. Both sashes can operate independently, providing flexibility for airflow and ease of use.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Two Sliding Sashes:</h5> Both panels glide horizontally, allowing ventilation from either side.</p>
              <p><h5>Effortless Operation:</h5> Designed for smooth and easy opening and closing with minimal force.</p>
              <p><h5>Removable Sashes:</h5> Each sash can often be lifted out of the frame for convenient cleaning and maintenance.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior Screen:</h5> A full-width screen is typically mounted on the outside to keep insects out while maximizing airflow.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Wide Openings:</h5> Double-slider windows offer broad, unobstructed openings ideal for maximum ventilation and emergency egress.</p>
              <p><h5>Balanced Ventilation:</h5> Both sashes can be adjusted to control airflow from either side for optimal comfort.</p>
              <p><h5>Low Maintenance:</h5> With fewer moving parts compared to crank or hinged windows, these units require minimal upkeep.</p>
              <p><h5>Space-Saving Design:</h5> Because the sashes slide within the frame, they do not protrude outward, making them ideal for walkways, or tight exterior spaces.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Commonly installed in living rooms, bedrooms, and basements for their practicality and balanced ventilation.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>End-vent slider windows are a type of horizontal sliding window that feature a fixed center pane and two operable side panes. This design allows for both a wide, unobstructed view and flexible ventilation from either side.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Fixed Center Pane:</h5> The large middle section remains stationary, providing a clear, uninterrupted view.</p>
              <p><h5>Sliding Side Panes:</h5> The left and right panels slide horizontally to allow controlled airflow.</p>
              <p><h5>Low-Profile Design:</h5> The frame offers a modern, streamlined appearance suitable for contemporary homes.</p>
              <p><h5>1/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 Configuration:</h5> Three equal panels—one fixed in the center and two operable on each side—create a balanced, symmetrical look.</p>
              <p><h5>1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 Configuration:</h5> The wider center panel and narrower side sliders offer a panoramic view with efficient ventilation.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are positioned on the outside of the sliding panels to prevent insects from entering while maintaining full functionality.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Expansive Ventilation:</h5> Both side sashes can open to provide generous airflow across the room.</p>
              <p><h5>Clear Visibility:</h5> The center fixed panel delivers a wide, unobstructed view of the outdoors.</p>
              <p><h5>Ideal for Large Openings:</h5> Perfect for spaces too wide for traditional double sliders, maintaining structural integrity and aesthetics.</p>
              <p><h5>Smooth Operation:</h5> The sliding panels glide easily for effortless opening and closing.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Garden windows are three-dimensional, box-shaped windows that extend outward from a home's exterior wall. They create a mini-greenhouse effect, offering space to grow plants, display decorations, or simply enjoy increased natural light.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Box-Shaped Design:</h5> Projects outward from the wall, creating an enclosed area that adds depth and dimension to the room.</p>
              <p><h5>Multiple Panes:</h5> Includes a large fixed center pane, angled side panes, and a sloped top pane to maximize sunlight exposure.</p>
              <p><h5>Ventilation:</h5> Often designed with operable casement-style side panels for airflow and temperature control.</p>
              <p><h5>Built-in Shelves:</h5> Many models include glass or insulated shelves for displaying plants or decorative pieces.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Circle top windows — also known as arch windows or half-moon windows — feature a gracefully curved or semi-circular design. They are typically installed above standard rectangular windows or doors to enhance architectural beauty and allow additional natural light into a room.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Curved or Semi-Circular Shape:</h5> Designed with an elegant arch, ranging from a perfect half-circle to a soft elliptical curve.</p>
              <p><h5>Fixed Pane:</h5> These windows are non-operable, meaning they remain stationary and serve primarily for aesthetics and lighting.</p>
              <p><h5>Decorative Element:</h5> Often incorporated as an architectural accent, circle top windows add character and sophistication to a building's design.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Natural Light:</h5> Positioned high on walls, circle top windows allow sunlight to filter in, brightening spaces without compromising privacy.</p>

              <p><h5>Design Versatility:</h5> Easily paired with other window styles — such as casement, picture, or double-hung windows — to create a seamless and elegant window composition.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Frequently used in living rooms, foyers, and bedrooms to introduce natural light and decorative appeal.</p>
              <p><h5>Above Doors or Rectangular Windows:</h5> Commonly placed above entry doors or picture windows, emphasizing height and enhancing the home's exterior design.</p>
