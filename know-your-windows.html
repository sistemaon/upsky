            <h2 class="inner-title">Double Hung Windows</h2>
            <div class="our-story">
              <!-- <h4>Definition</h4> -->
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>A double-hung window is a type of window made up of two separate sashes — one on the top and one on the bottom — that slide vertically within the frame. Both sashes move independently, meaning you can open either the top, the bottom, or both at the same time.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Two Movable Sashes:</h5> Each sash operates on its own track, allowing flexible ventilation. You can open the bottom sash to let fresh air in, or open the top sash to release warm air.</p>
              <p><h5>Tilt-in design:</h5> Both sashes can tilt inward, making it easy to clean the exterior glass from inside your home without using a ladder.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior screen:</h5> The screen is placed on the outside of the window, preventing insects from entering while the window is open.</p>
              <p><h5>Block and tackle balance system:</h5> Inside the frame, a system of cords and pulleys helps the sashes move smoothly up and down. This system is built for long-term use and can withstand thousands of open-and-close cycles before any maintenance is needed.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Flexible ventilation:</h5> Double-hung windows allow you to control airflow naturally. Opening both sashes lets warm air escape through the top and cool air enter through the bottom, improving comfort and air circulation.</p>
              <p><h5>Easy maintenance:</h5> The tilt-in feature makes cleaning quick and safe, since both sides of the glass are accessible from inside the home.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> Modern double-hung windows are designed with insulated glass and advanced weather sealing, helping to reduce drafts and improve energy performance year-round.</p>
              <p><h5>Classic appearance:</h5> Their traditional design complements most home styles, from historic to contemporary, adding a timeless look to the exterior.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Double-hung windows are among the most popular styles in homes because they combine beauty, function, and convenience.</p>
              <p><h5>Limited Exterior Space:</h5> Because the sashes move vertically rather than swinging outward, these windows are ideal for areas where space outside is limited — such as near walkways, porches, or patios.</p>

            <h2 class="inner-title">Casement Windows</h2>
            <div class="our-story">
              <!-- <h4>Definition</h4> -->
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Casement windows are hinged windows that open outward like a door. They are typically operated by a crank or lever mechanism, allowing easy and precise control over how far the window opens.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Hinged Design:</h5> Casement windows are hinged on one side, enabling them to swing open either to the left or right.</p>
              <p><h5>Crank or Lever Operation:</h5> Operated by a crank or lever, these windows allow smooth and adjustable opening and closing.</p>
              <p><h5>Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are generally installed on the inside to protect them from weather exposure and to keep insects out when the window is open.</p>
              <p><h5>Blinds Between the Glass:</h5> Casement windows can be customized with integrated blinds positioned between the glass panes. This feature provides a clean, low-maintenance appearance and allows for easy light control. (Note: blinds between the glass cannot be combined with decorative grids.)</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Unobstructed Views:</h5> Casement windows feature large, uninterrupted glass panels that enhance natural light and provide clear outdoor visibility.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> The sash presses firmly against the frame when closed, creating a tight seal that minimizes air leakage and improves thermal performance.</p>
              <p><h5>Superior Ventilation:</h5> When opened, the sash catches and directs breezes into the home, maximizing airflow.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Security:</h5> Casement windows often include hook-shaped locks embedded into the frame, making them highly resistant to forced entry.</p>
              <p><h5>Modern Customization Options:</h5> Integrated blinds between the glass offer a neat, contemporary appearance and are easy to operate and maintain.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Widely used in homes for their combination of ventilation, visibility, and energy efficiency.</p>
              <p><h5>Modern and Contemporary Architecture:</h5> Their clean lines and functional design complement modern architectural aesthetics.</p>
              <p><h5>Rooms Requiring Controlled Ventilation:</h5> Ideal for areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, or any space where precise airflow control is desired.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Hopper windows are small, hinged windows that open inward from the top. They are typically used in basements, bathrooms, or other confined areas where ventilation and natural light are needed.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Bottom-Hinged Design:</h5> Hopper windows are hinged at the bottom, allowing them to open inward from the top.</p>
              <p><h5>Compact Size:</h5> Their smaller dimensions make them ideal for spaces with limited room.</p>
              <p><h5>Locking Mechanism:</h5> They feature secure locks that keep the window tightly closed when not in use.</p>
              <p><h5>Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are positioned on the exterior side to prevent insects from entering when the window is open.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Efficient Ventilation:</h5> Hopper windows provide strong air circulation, making them great for humid or enclosed spaces.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Security:</h5> Their inward-opening design and locking system make them hard to force open from the outside.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> When closed, they form a tight seal that minimizes drafts and improves insulation.</p>
              <p><h5>Easy Maintenance:</h5> The inward-opening motion allows easy cleaning of both interior and exterior glass surfaces.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Basements:</h5> Commonly used to allow fresh air and light in underground or partially below-ground rooms.</p>
              <p><h5>Bathrooms:</h5> Provide ventilation and moisture control while maintaining privacy.</p>
              <p><h5>Compact Spaces:</h5> Perfect for tight or narrow wall openings where standard windows won't fit.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Double-slider windows feature two horizontally sliding sashes that move side-to-side within a single frame. Both sashes can operate independently, providing flexibility for airflow and ease of use.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Two Sliding Sashes:</h5> Both panels glide horizontally, allowing ventilation from either side.</p>
              <p><h5>Effortless Operation:</h5> Designed for smooth and easy opening and closing with minimal force.</p>
              <p><h5>Removable Sashes:</h5> Each sash can often be lifted out of the frame for convenient cleaning and maintenance.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior Screen:</h5> A full-width screen is typically mounted on the outside to keep insects out while maximizing airflow.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Wide Openings:</h5> Double-slider windows offer broad, unobstructed openings ideal for maximum ventilation and emergency egress.</p>
              <p><h5>Balanced Ventilation:</h5> Both sashes can be adjusted to control airflow from either side for optimal comfort.</p>
              <p><h5>Low Maintenance:</h5> With fewer moving parts compared to crank or hinged windows, these units require minimal upkeep.</p>
              <p><h5>Space-Saving Design:</h5> Because the sashes slide within the frame, they do not protrude outward, making them ideal for walkways, or tight exterior spaces.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Commonly installed in living rooms, bedrooms, and basements for their practicality and balanced ventilation.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>End-vent slider windows are a type of horizontal sliding window that feature a fixed center pane and two operable side panes. This design allows for both a wide, unobstructed view and flexible ventilation from either side.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Fixed Center Pane:</h5> The large middle section remains stationary, providing a clear, uninterrupted view.</p>
              <p><h5>Sliding Side Panes:</h5> The left and right panels slide horizontally to allow controlled airflow.</p>
              <p><h5>Low-Profile Design:</h5> The frame offers a modern, streamlined appearance suitable for contemporary homes.</p>
              <p><h5>1/3 | 1/3 | 1/3 Configuration:</h5> Three equal panels—one fixed in the center and two operable on each side—create a balanced, symmetrical look.</p>
              <p><h5>1/4 | 2/4 | 1/4 Configuration:</h5> The wider center panel and narrower side sliders offer a panoramic view with efficient ventilation.</p>
              <p><h5>Exterior Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are positioned on the outside of the sliding panels to prevent insects from entering while maintaining full functionality.</p>

              <p><h5>Expansive Ventilation:</h5> Both side sashes can open to provide generous airflow across the room.</p>
              <p><h5>Clear Visibility:</h5> The center fixed panel delivers a wide, unobstructed view of the outdoors.</p>
              <p><h5>Ideal for Large Openings:</h5> Perfect for spaces too wide for traditional double sliders, maintaining structural integrity and aesthetics.</p>
              <p><h5>Smooth Operation:</h5> The sliding panels glide easily for effortless opening and closing.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Garden windows are three-dimensional, box-shaped windows that extend outward from a home's exterior wall. They create a mini-greenhouse effect, offering space to grow plants, display decorations, or simply enjoy increased natural light.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Box-Shaped Design:</h5> Projects outward from the wall, creating an enclosed area that adds depth and dimension to the room.</p>
              <p><h5>Multiple Panes:</h5> Includes a large fixed center pane, angled side panes, and a sloped top pane to maximize sunlight exposure.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Circle top windows — also known as arch windows or half-moon windows — feature a gracefully curved or semi-circular design. They are typically installed above standard rectangular windows or doors to enhance architectural beauty and allow additional natural light into a room.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Curved or Semi-Circular Shape:</h5> Designed with an elegant arch, ranging from a perfect half-circle to a soft elliptical curve.</p>
              <p><h5>Fixed Pane:</h5> These windows are non-operable, meaning they remain stationary and serve primarily for aesthetics and lighting.</p>
              <p><h5>Decorative Element:</h5> Often incorporated as an architectural accent, circle top windows add character and sophistication to a building's design.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Natural Light:</h5> Positioned high on walls, circle top windows allow sunlight to filter in, brightening spaces without compromising privacy.</p>

              <p><h5>Design Versatility:</h5> Easily paired with other window styles — such as casement, picture, or double-hung windows — to create a seamless and elegant window composition.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Frequently used in living rooms, foyers, and bedrooms to introduce natural light and decorative appeal.</p>

              <p>Picture windows are large, fixed-pane windows designed to provide wide, unobstructed views and abundant natural light. They are often used as a focal point in a room or to highlight scenic outdoor views.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Fixed Pane:</h5> Picture windows do not open, offering a clean, secure, and maintenance-free design.</p>
              <p><h5>Unobstructed Views:</h5> With no moving sashes or screens, they provide clear, uninterrupted views.</p>
              <p><h5>Thermal Efficiency:</h5> These windows typically feature low U-factor glass, providing excellent insulation.</p>
              <p><h5>Minimal Air Leakage:</h5> Their sealed design ensures superior energy performance and reduced drafts.</p>
              <p><h5>Flexible Design:</h5> Picture windows can be installed alone or combined with other styles (such as casement or double-hung) for a customized appearance.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Natural Light:</h5> Maximizes daylight entry, brightening interior spaces.</p>
              <p><h5>Energy Efficiency:</h5> Fixed panes and insulated glass reduce heat transfer, helping maintain comfortable indoor temperatures.</p>
              <p><h5>Aesthetic Appeal:</h5> Their sleek design and expansive glass surface add architectural beauty and a modern touch.</p>
              <p><h5>Versatility:</h5> Works well in living rooms, stairwells, or any area where a wide view is desired.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Residential Applications:</h5> Picture windows are popular in residential homes and modern buildings where maximizing light and outdoor views is a priority. They are often used in living rooms, great rooms, or spaces with scenic surroundings.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Awning windows are windows that are hinged at the top and open outward from the bottom. This design allows for ventilation while helping protect the interior of the home from rain and debris.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Top-Hinged Design:</h5> Awning windows are hinged along the top of the frame, allowing the bottom of the sash to swing outward when opened.</p>
              <p><h5>Operation:</h5> These windows are typically operated using a crank or lever, giving the user precise control over how far the window opens.</p>
              <p><h5>Efficient Ventilation:</h5> Because the window opens outward, it can provide airflow even during light rain without allowing water to enter the home.</p>
              <p><h5>Interior Screen Placement:</h5> Screens are usually installed on the interior side of the window, protecting them from weather exposure and preventing insects from entering when the window is open.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Excellent Ventilation:</h5> Awning windows promote strong airflow while still offering protection from rain.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Security:</h5> When closed and locked, the outward-opening design makes these windows difficult to force open from the exterior.</p>
              <p><h5>Ease of Cleaning:</h5> Many awning windows feature designs that allow for easier access when cleaning both interior and exterior surfaces.</p>
              <p><h5>Versatility:</h5> Awning windows can be installed higher on walls or above doors, providing ventilation and natural light without sacrificing privacy.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Bathrooms:</h5> Awning windows are well-suited for bathrooms due to their ability to provide ventilation while maintaining privacy and managing moisture.</p>
              <p><h5>Kitchens:</h5> Awning windows are often installed above sinks or countertops, allowing for airflow without interfering with usable workspace.</p>

              <!-- <h4>Definition</h4> -->
              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Bay windows are a window configuration made up of three windows that extend outward from the exterior wall, forming a bay or alcove inside the room. They are designed to enhance views, increase natural light, and create additional interior space.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Configuration:</h5> Bay windows consist of three separate window units: a large center window and two angled side windows known as flankers.</p>
              <p><h5>Fixed:</h5> The center window is typically fixed, providing unobstructed views and maximizing natural light.</p>
              <p><h5>Operable Flanker:</h5> The side windows are commonly double-hung or casement styles, allowing for ventilation while maintaining the bay's overall appearance.</p>
              <p><h5>Structural Cable:</h5> Bay windows use heavy-duty cables or rods to properly support the projection and ensure long-term structural stability.</p>
              <p><h5>Seatboard:</h5> An insulated seatboard is included, improving energy efficiency and creating a usable interior ledge for seating, storage, or décor.</p>
              <p><h5>Design:</h5> Bay windows are commonly manufactured in 30° or 45° angles, offering flexibility in design and projection depth.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Natural Light:</h5> The multi-angle design allows sunlight to enter from several directions, brightening the room.</p>
              <p><h5>Space:</h5> Bay windows create extra usable space inside the home, often used for seating, shelving, or decorative elements.</p>
              <p><h5>Enhanced Aesthetics:</h5> The outward projection provides wider, panoramic views and adds architectural character to both the interior and exterior of the home.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
              <p><h5>Living Rooms:</h5> Bay windows are frequently installed in living rooms, where they serve as a focal point and create comfortable seating or display areas.</p>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Bow windows are a series of windows that project outward from the exterior wall in a smooth, curved formation. This design creates an elegant appearance while increasing natural light, expanding interior space, and enhancing exterior views.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Configuration:</h5> Bow windows are designed to form a gentle arc, creating a soft, rounded projection that adds architectural character to the home.</p>
              <p><h5>Option:</h5> Bow windows are available in 3-lite, 4-lite, or 5-lite configurations, with each “lite” representing an individual window unit within the bow.</p>
              <p><h5>Design:</h5> Each window within a bow is typically set at a 10° angle, allowing the units to align seamlessly and create a smooth, continuous curve.</p>

              <h3>Advantages</h3>
              <p><h5>Natural Light:</h5> The curved layout captures sunlight from multiple directions, brightening the interior space throughout the day.</p>
              <p><h5>Panoramic:</h5> Bow windows provide wide, sweeping views of the outdoors, making rooms feel more open and connected to the exterior.</p>
              <p><h5>Space:</h5> The outward projection creates additional usable space inside the room, often used for seating, plants, or decorative displays.</p>
              <p><h5>Architectural:</h5> Bow windows add a distinctive and visually appealing element to a home, elevating both interior and exterior design.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>

              <h3>Definition</h3>
              <p>Sliding patio doors are large glass doors that slide horizontally on a track, providing easy access to outdoor spaces while maximizing natural light and views.</p>

              <h3>Features</h3>
              <p><h5>Configuration:</h5> Sliding patio doors are available in two- or three-panel configurations, depending on the size of the opening and design preference.</p>
              <p><h5>Built-in:</h5> Optional built-in blinds between the glass panes provide privacy, light control, and a clean, low-maintenance solution.</p>
              <p><h5>Security:</h5> Many sliding patio doors feature a multi-point locking system, improving security and helping create a tighter seal against air and drafts.</p>

              <p><h5>Natural Light:</h5> Large glass panels allow natural light to fill the space while maintaining wide, unobstructed views.</p>
              <p><h5>Space:</h5> Because sliding patio doors operate on a horizontal track, they do not require additional space to swing open or closed.</p>
              <p><h5>Customization:</h5> A variety of panel layouts, glass options, and internal blind features allow for customization to suit different needs and styles.</p>

              <h3>Common Uses</h3>
